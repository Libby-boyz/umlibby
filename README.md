# StudyNav

## Inspiration
Throughout our university careers, we have all wasted countless hours hunting for a seat when we should have been focused on our work. This led us to the realisation that students lack the information they need to use the little time they have effectively.

## What it does
StudyNav provides a list of study locations along with real time occupancy tracking to help students find an open place to work. By integrating a live interactive map, our system allows users to visualise where study spots are around campus, and check their availability. Instead of blindly walking from building to building, students can see  where the busy spots are and head to quieter, less crowded alternatives.
